abstract = {This paper employs techniques and algorithms from the fields of natural language processing, graph representation learning and word embeddings to assist project managers in the task of personnel selection. To do so, our approach initially represents multiple textual documents as a single graph. Then, it computes word embeddings through representation learning on graphs and performs feature selection. Finally, it builds a classification model that is able to estimate how qualified a candidate employee is to work on a given task, taking as input only the descriptions of the tasks and a list of word embeddings. Our approach differs from the existing ones in that it does not require the calculation of key performance indicators or any other form of structured data in order to operate properly. For our experiments, we retrieved data from the Jira issue tracking system of the Apache Software Foundation. The evaluation results show, in most cases, an increase of 0.43% in the accuracy of the proposed classification models when compared against a widely-adopted baseline method, while their validation loss is significantly decreased by 65.54%.},

ABSTRACT = {Today, there are excellent resources for the semantic annotation of biomedical text. These resources span from ontologies, tools for NLP, annotators, and web services. Most of these are available either in the form of open source components (i.e., MetaMap) or as web services that offer free access (i.e., Whatizit). In order to use these resources in automatic text annotation pipelines, researchers face significant technical challenges. For open-source tools, the challenges include the setting up of the computational environment, the resolution of dependencies, as well as the compilation and installation of the software. For web services, the challenge is implementing clients to undertake communication with the respective web APIs. Even resources that are available as Docker containers (i.e., NCBO annotator) require significant technical skills for installation and setup. This work deals with the task of creating ready-to-install and run Research Objects (ROs) for a large collection of components in biomedical text analysis. These components include (a) tools such as cTAKES, NOBLE Coder, MetaMap, NCBO annotator, BeCAS, and Neji; (b) ontologies from BioPortal, NCBI BioSystems, and Open Biomedical Ontologies; and (c) text corpora such as BC4GO, Mantra Gold Standard Corpus, and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. We make these resources available in OpenBio.eu, an open-science RO repository and workflow management system. All ROs can be searched, shared, edited, downloaded, commented on, and rated. We also demonstrate how one can easily connect these ROs to form a large variety of text annotation pipelines.},

ABSTRACT = {We consider the prediction of future research collaborations as a link prediction problem applied on a scientific knowledge graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the prediction of future research collaborations that combines structural and textual information of a scientific knowledge graph through a purposeful integration of graph algorithms and natural language processing techniques. Our work: (i) investigates whether the integration of unstructured textual data into a single knowledge graph affects the performance of a link prediction model, (ii) studies the effect of previously proposed graph kernels based approaches on the performance of an ML model, as far as the link prediction problem is concerned, and (iii) proposes a three-phase pipeline that enables the exploitation of structural and textual information, as well as of pre-trained word embeddings. We benchmark the proposed approach against classical link prediction algorithms using accuracy, recall, and precision as our performance metrics. Finally, we empirically test our approach through various feature combinations with respect to the link prediction problem. Our experimentations with the new COVID-19 Open Research Dataset demonstrate a significant improvement of the abovementioned performance metrics in the prediction of future research collaborations.},

abstract="Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in information management, which is often used as a preliminary step in various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks. The main contribution of this paper lies in providing a comparative assessment of prominent multilingual unsupervised keyphrase extraction methods that build on statistical (RAKE, YAKE), graph-based (TextRank, SingleRank) and deep learning (KeyBERT) methods. For the experimentations reported in this paper, we employ well-known datasets designed for keyphrase extraction from five different natural languages (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Polish). We use the F1 score and a partial match evaluation framework, aiming to investigate whether the number of terms of the documents and the language of each dataset affect the accuracy of the selected methods. Our experimental results reveal a set of insights about the suitability of the selected methods in texts of different sizes, as well as the performance of these methods in datasets of different languages.",

abstract="Project Management is a complex practice that is associated with a series of challenges such as handling of conflicts and dependencies in resource allocation, fine tuning of projects to avoid fragmented planning, handling of potential opportunities or threats during the execution of a project, and alignment between projects and business objectives. Traditionally, methods and tools to address these issues are based on analytical approaches developed in the realm of the Operations Research discipline. Aiming to facilitate and augment the quality of the Project Management practice, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that builds on the synergy between contemporary Machine Learning and Operations Research techniques. Based on past data, Machine Learning techniques can predict undesired situations, provide timely warnings and recommend preventive actions regarding problematic resource loads or deviations from business priority lists. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated through two real examples elaborating two different datasets. In these examples, we comment on the proper orchestration of the associated Operations Research and Machine Learning algorithms, paying equal attention to both optimization and big data manipulation issues.",

title="Parallelization of “burn scar mapping” algorithms - Παραλληλοποίηση αλγορίθμων χαρτογράφησης καμένων εκτάσεων σε δορυφορικά δεδομένα",
abstract={Nowadays, the plant life all over the world is decreasing rapidly. On the contrary, the breakouts of fires, in forests, are increasing. As a result, many programs and missions have been created, as far as remote sensing is concerned. Their goal is to collect data, in order to map out burnt areas. NASA's Landsat
Program provides information that can be used in terms of 'burn-scar' mapping. ESA (European Space
Agency) also offers its services via the program 'Copernicus' which is responsible for satellite missions
called 'Sentinels'.
The National Observatory of Athens has played a significant role in mapping out burnt areas
throughout Greek territory, by developing different systems, which apply algorithms and filters on digital
image processing. The data used is mostly from the Landsat Program, due to the fact its' satellite
images are high quality and large in size. Therefore, the need for processing a large number of images
that are also big in size, makes sequential implementation of the system not sufficient enough, as far
as time is concerned.
This thesis has worked on the algorithm and filter parallelization of the 'burn-scar' mapping system
that was implemented by the National Observatory of Athens. For the actualization of the thesis,
the programming language Python and Message Passing Interface (MPI) are used. The parallelization
achieves a decrease of the total execution time from 14,7 minutes to less than 1 minute, using up to
33 quad-core computers at the lab of the Department of Informatics and Telematics.},
