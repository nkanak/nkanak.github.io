#### **Academic world**

I am a **final-year Ph.D. Candidate** at the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Patras (Industrial Management and Information Systems Laboratory, supervisor: [Nikos Karacapilidis](http://imis.upatras.gr/nikos/)).

I hold a **BSc. in Computer Science** from the Department of [Informatics and Telematics](https://dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/), Harokopio University of Athens, where I conducted the research for my final thesis under the supervision of [Dimitrios Michail](https://d-michail.github.io/).

My research aims to exploit existing techniques and methods from the fields of **graph theory**, **graph mining**, **natural language processing**, **knowledge management** and **machine learning** in order to improve graph-based text representation and graph-based natural language processing.
I am interested in natural language processing, applied machine learning, and graph mining.
I am currently studying techniques related to graph neural networks and graph-based natural language processing. In particular, advancing common natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, feature extraction and feature selection, using graph-based text representations, word embeddings, and graph neural networks.

An example of a representation of multiple textual documents as a single graph (graph-of-docs) is available on GitHub ([link](https://github.com/NC0DER/GraphOfDocs)).

#### **Outer world**
I have also worked outside of the academic world for a list of companies as a **software engineer** and as a **freelancer** on various multi-domain projects (not afraid of getting my hands dirty).

In my free time, I love to listen to podcasts on Spotify, read books highlighting the power of the mind, experiment with new technologies and automotive electronics, and work out. I am also an active reviewer of programming books at Manning Publications.

#### **Beliefs**
I try not to be dogmatized regarding programming languages and technologies (after all, they are just tools that help you with a specific task); each tool and language has its own purpose. However, most of my academic work is developed using Python. Thus far, for the industrial projects, I have developed many solutions in Python, JavaScript/Node.js and C++. Recently, I introduced the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language to myself and I am using it (accompanied by Python) for data analysis tasks (e.g. manipulating data frames, providing descriptive statistics, and approaching basic classification problems). I think Julia has huge potential and can benefit everyone by using it.
