#### **Current status**
* Working as a **Data Scientist** at [efood](https://www.e-food.gr/) (a brand of [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/))
* **Final-year Ph.D. candidate** at the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Patras (Industrial Management and Information Systems Laboratory, supervisor: [Nikos Karacapilidis](http://imis.upatras.gr/nikos/)).
* Working as a Machine learning researcher for various EU and Greek-funded projects
* Developing full stack software solutions and performing data analyses for startups
* Experience both in academia and industry

#### **Academic world**
I hold a **BSc. in Computer Science** from the Department of [Informatics and Telematics](https://dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/), Harokopio University of Athens, where I completed my thesis under the supervision of [Dimitrios Michail](https://d-michail.github.io/).

My current research aims to exploit existing techniques and methods from the fields of **graph theory**, **graph mining**, **natural language processing**, **knowledge management** and **machine learning** in order to improve graph-based text representation and graph-based natural language processing.
I am interested in natural language processing, applied machine learning, and graph mining.
I am currently studying techniques related to graph neural networks and graph-based natural language processing. In particular, advancing common natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, feature extraction and feature selection, using graph-based text representations, word embeddings, and graph neural networks.

An example of a representation of multiple textual documents as a single graph (graph-of-docs) is available on GitHub ([link](https://github.com/NC0DER/GraphOfDocs)).

#### **Industrial & outer world**
I have also worked outside of the academic world for many companies as a software engineer and as a freelancer on various multi-domain projects (not afraid of getting my hands dirty). Hence, I can natively operate both in academia and industry, in a similar fashion to a hybrid car.

In my free time, I love to listen to podcasts on Spotify, read books highlighting the power of the mind and work out. Along with my previous spiritual-oriented and wellbeing hobbies, I am always curious about new applied engineering and automotive technologies. Thus, I frequently find myself experimenting with electronics such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, 3D printing (recently, I bought the new Prusa printer), CAD design,
lathe and milling machines. Particularly, my passion is rapidly exploded when these technologies are combined with data collection, data analysis and machine learning.

I am also an active reviewer of programming books at Manning Publications and in various scientific Journals and conferences, including AIRE (9.588 IF), PLOS ONE, MDPI and IEEE.

#### **My view on code**
I try not to be dogmatized regarding programming languages and technologies (after all, they are just tools that help you with a specific task); each tool and language has its own purpose. However, most of my academic work is developed using Python. Thus far, for the industrial projects, I have developed many solutions in Python, JavaScript/Node.js and C++. Recently, I incorporated the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language into my tool set and I am using it (accompanied by Python) for data analysis tasks (e.g. manipulating data frames, providing descriptive statistics, and approaching basic classification problems). In my opinion, Julia has a lot of potential and everyone could benefit from using it.
